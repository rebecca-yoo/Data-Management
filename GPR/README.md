##Background and research objective
1. The primary objective for this project is to understand the potential to study genomic medicine practices from clinical databases at Johns Hopkins Medicine (JHM) Institutions. Our broader goal is to use what we learn to design a new registry for use to study what are (in)effective clinical practices, with and without genomics.
2. The primary research question is: Can data that are passively captured from patient electronic medical records be used to derive prevalence, variety, and distribution of genomic medicine practices at JHM? 
3. The secondary research question is: Is there a difference in our capability and performance to derive the prevalence, variety, and distribution of genomic medicine practices in a primary care setting when compared to a specialty genetics care setting?
