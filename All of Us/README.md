## Background
Formerly known as the "Precision Medicine Initiative" cohort program, All of Us aims to enroll 1 million people for their EHR, biospecimens, surveys, and physical measurements. They also place emphasis on recruiting people who are underrepresented in biomedical research, such as those with poor access to healthcare. Volunteer recruitment began in May 2017 with the enrollment of the program's first participant. Participants enroll online to register, authorize sharing of their electronic health records (EHR), and subsequently fill out surveys for demographic information. Participants are then instructed to provide physical measurements and biologic samples by either going to a nearby health care provider or using a "direct volunteer" method. Anyone living in the US who are 18 and up can participate.
